# Email Service Refactor Changes

## Overview
This document details the refactoring of the email services to follow better software engineering practices and improve maintainability.

## Before Refactoring

### SymfonyMailer.php
- Single email sending service
- Responsibilities: Email creation, sending, transport selection, content embedding
- Issues: Large class, mixed concerns (email logic + transport logic)

### SymfonyMailerHelper.php  
- High-level email operations
- Responsibilities: Email sending logic, database logging, flash messages, URL generation, error handling
- Issues: Violates Single Responsibility Principle, too many responsibilities, tight coupling

## Problems Identified

1. **Single Responsibility Violation**: `SymfonyMailerHelper` was doing too many things
2. **Tight Coupling**: Multiple services tightly coupled together (Doctrine, FlashyBundle, Router)
3. **Poor Testability**: Classes were hard to unit test due to multiple dependencies
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Mixed logging and notification approaches
5. **Code Duplication**: Similar error handling patterns repeated throughout

## After Refactoring

### EmailService.php (renamed from SymfonyMailer.php)
- Single responsibility: Construct and send emails
- Uses dependency injection for mailer, twig, transports, etc.
- Returns boolean to indicate success/failure
- Handles transport selection (Yahoo vs main SMTP)
- Handles email attachments and embedded content

### EmailLoggerService.php (new class)
- Single responsibility: Log email activities to database
- Handles all database interactions for email logging
- Provides specific methods for different email types
- Centralized email logging logic

### EmailNotifierService.php (new class)
- Single responsibility: Provide user feedback via flash messages
- Contains all notification logic in one place
- Provides specific methods for different email types
- Decouples flash messaging from email logic

### EmailManagerService.php (renamed from SymfonyMailerHelper.php)
- Single responsibility: Coordinate email operations
- Orchestrates email sending, logging, and notification
- Handles URL generation and document preparation
- Proper error handling and logging
- Maintains the original API for easy migration

## Key Changes

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Email creation/sending → EmailService
- Database logging → EmailLoggerService  
- User notifications → EmailNotifierService
- Business logic coordination → EmailManagerService

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in EmailManagerService
- Proper exception propagation
- Separate logging for different failure scenarios
- Boolean return values for success/failure tracking

### 3. Better Testability
- Each service has a single responsibility
- Smaller, focused classes that are easier to unit test
- Clearer interfaces and dependencies
- Mock-friendly design

### 4. Improved Maintainability
- Clearer code organization
- Easier to modify individual components
- Reduced coupling between services
- More predictable behavior

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each class has a clear purpose and is easier to modify
2. **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new email types or modify existing ones
4. **Debuggability**: Issues can be traced to specific components more easily
5. **Reusability**: Email service can be used independently of logging/notifications

## Migration Notes

1. Replace instances of `SymfonyMailerHelper` with `EmailManagerService`
2. For direct email operations, use `EmailService` directly
3. For logging, use `EmailLoggerService`
4. For notifications, use `EmailNotifierService`
5. Existing API calls remain the same, no changes needed in controllers

## Pattern Used

The refactored code follows the **Separation of Concerns** principle with a **Service Layer** pattern. Each service has a single responsibility and can be composed together to achieve complex functionality while remaining modular and testable.
