# Modern Vehicle Planning System - Enhanced Version

## Overview
This is an enhanced version of the modern vehicle planning system that addresses the issues with timeline positioning and vehicle selection. It provides a more accurate representation of vehicle reservations with proper duration-based positioning, similar to the original dhtmlxGantt implementation.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Accurate Timeline Positioning
- **Fixed Duration Calculation**: Reservations now correctly span their actual duration in days
- **Proper Positioning**: Each reservation is positioned based on its exact start and end dates
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Timeline adjusts pixel density based on the selected view period (7 days to 2 months)

### 2. Enhanced Vehicle Selection
- **Sidebar Vehicle List**: Left sidebar with selectable vehicle items
- **Checkbox Selection**: Individual vehicle selection with checkbox toggles
- **Multi-Vehicle Display**: Show/hide vehicles as needed
- **Reservation Count**: Each vehicle shows its number of reservations

### 3. Multiple Time Period Views
- **7 Days (Week)**: Default view showing one week
- **14 Days (Fortnight)**: Two-week view
- **30 Days (Month)**: One-month view
- **60 Days (Bimonth)**: Two-month view

### 4. Responsive Design
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Touch Optimization**: Works well on touch devices
- **Flexible Layout**: Adjusts components based on available space

└── js/
    └── modern_planning.js          # Complete implementation with accurate positioning
```

### Core Features

#### 1. Timeline Positioning Algorithm
```javascript
calculateReservationPosition(startDate, endDate) {
    // Calculate the difference in milliseconds
    const startTime = startDate.getTime();
    const endTime = endDate.getTime();
    const planningStartTime = this.startDate.getTime();
    const planningEndTime = this.endDate.getTime();
    
    // Calculate position as percentage of timeline
    const totalDuration = planningEndTime - planningStartTime;
    const startOffset = startTime - planningStartTime;
    const reservationDuration = endTime - startTime;
    
    // Convert to pixels with dynamic scaling
    const daysInRange = (this.endDate - this.startDate) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    const pixelsPerDay = Math.max(80, 1000 / daysInRange);
    
    const leftDays = startOffset / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    const widthDays = reservationDuration / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    
    const left = Math.max(0, leftDays * pixelsPerDay);
    const width = Math.max(50, widthDays * pixelsPerDay);
    
    return { left, width };
}
```

#### 2. Vehicle Selection Management
- **Set-Based Selection**: Uses JavaScript Set for efficient vehicle selection tracking
- **Individual Toggle**: Click on vehicles to toggle their visibility
- **Select All**: Default behavior shows all vehicles
- **Persistent State**: Maintains selection state during navigation

#### 3. Date Range Management
- **Dynamic End Dates**: Automatically calculates end date based on view selection
- **Date Picker Integration**: HTML5 date input for custom start dates
- **View-Specific Ranges**: 
  - Week: Start date + 6 days
  - Fortnight: Start date + 13 days
  - Month: Start date + 29 days
  - Bimonth: Start date + 59 days

### User Interface Components

#### 1. Header Controls
- **Date Selector**: Choose the planning start date
- **View Buttons**: Switch between different time periods
- **Reset Button**: Return to default view

#### 2. Vehicle Sidebar
- **Search Filter**: Filter vehicles by name
- **Vehicle List**: Scrollable list of all vehicles
- **Selection Indicators**: Visual feedback for selected vehicles
- **Reservation Counts**: Number of reservations per vehicle

#### 3. Timeline View
- **Header Days**: Shows days with proper weekend highlighting
- **Vehicle Rows**: Each row represents one vehicle
- **Reservation Blocks**: Positioned accurately based on duration
- **Status Indicators**: Different colors for reservation types and statuses

#### 4. Reservation Details
- **Modal Popup**: Detailed view of reservation information
- **Direct Editing**: Quick link to reservation edit page
- **Complete Information**: All reservation details in one view
